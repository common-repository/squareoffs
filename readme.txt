Easily add [SquareOffs](http://www.squareoffs.com/)® microdebates to your content to increase engagement, revenue, traffic, and insight.

== Description ==
This easy-to-use plugin allows you to embed SquareOffs® directly into your content without ever leaving Wordpress.

SquareOffs microdebates™ allow digital publishers of all sizes to engage readers, increase traffic, gain insight, and generate new revenue. They are more than just another poll. SquareOffs allow you to engage your readers in an interactive conversational debate where they not only choose a side, but can also explain “why” they made their choice. Readers love it because they can make their voice heard, invite others to join the conversation, vote up top reasons supporting their side, and easily access relevant comments within the innovative dual comment stream. Readers are kept on your site rather than social networks, allowing you to own the conversation.

>SquareOffs placed in an article receive 41% more comments than standard commenting systems.
>
>Readers spend an average of 13 seconds longer on article pages when interacting with a SquareOff.
